# Web Scraping Project

## Overview

This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract data from websites using Selenium and Python. It includes scripts to parse, scrape, and manage the extracted data efficiently. 

## Project Files

- **`main.py`**: The entry point of the project. This script coordinates the scraping and parsing processes.
- **`scrape.py`**: Contains functions and logic for performing web scraping tasks using Selenium.
- **`parse.py`**: Handles the parsing of scraped data into structured formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **`chromedriver.exe`**: The ChromeDriver executable required by Selenium for browser automation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. **Google Chrome**: The version of Chrome must match the version of `chromedriver.exe`.
3. **Selenium**: Install Selenium via pip (or ensure itâ€™s listed in `requirements.txt`).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/web-scraping-tool.git
   cd web-scraping-tool
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure `chromedriver.exe` is in the project root or accessible via your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Update the configuration in `main.py` or `scrape.py` to specify the target website and scraping parameters.

2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. The parsed data will be saved to the specified output file or displayed on the console, depending on the implementation in `parse.py`.

## Notes

- Ensure compliance with the website's terms of service before scraping.
- You may need to update `chromedriver.exe` if Chrome gets updated.
